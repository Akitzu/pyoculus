# pyoculus
A Python version of Oculus - The eye into the chaos: a comprehensive magnetic field diagnostic package for non-integrable, toroidal magnetic fields (and more general 1 1/2-D or 2D Hamiltonian system). Oculus is the Latin word for 'eye'.

## Usage

To use the package, simply import it in Python:
```python
import pyoculus
```

Examples can be found in the `examples` subfolder.

## Documentation

The documentation of pyoculus is managed by [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html).

You can find the documentation on Github Page: https://zhisong.github.io/pyoculus/

This documentation will be updated regularly but may not be most up-to-date. To generate the documentation from source, please run

```
make doxygen
```

The documentation will appear in the subfolder `doc/html`. Please open `doc/html/index.html` in your browser.

## SPEC magnetic field and Pressure Jump Hamiltonian (PJH) 

Some additional steps are needed to run pyoculus on outputs generated by 
the Stepped Pressure Equilibrium Code or [SPEC](https://princetonuniversity.github.io/SPEC/).

### Pre-requisite
The `py_spec` package that handles SPEC output.

### Compilation
To use the pyoculus on SPEC magnetic field and PJH, please compile the Fortran modules for SPEC by
```
pip3 install -e .
```
Documentation for `f2py` can be found [here](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/f2py/).
