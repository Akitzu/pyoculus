    Defines an abstract base class for the map subclasses.

    A map object is a function that takes a point in phase space to another point. The transformation can be either discrete or continuous. A continuous transformation allows the map to be applied for a continuous time (:math:`f^t` where :math:`t` is a real number), while a discrete transformation allows the map to be applied only for discrete times (:math:`f^t` where :math:`t` is an integer).

    Attributes:
        dimension (int): The dimension of the phase space that the map operates on.
        is_discrete (bool): A flag indicating whether the map is discrete. If True, the map is discrete; if False, the map is continuous.
        domain (list of tuples, optional): The domain of the map. Each tuple should contain the lower and upper bounds for each dimension. If None, the domain is assumed to be :math:`(-\\infty, \\infty)` for each dimension.
